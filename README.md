# My portfolio site
Using just [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) I was able to create this. Special? Kinda. At least I didn't use one of many templates and I'm trying to be as original as possible.

# How to launch?
As usual:
 1. Download the repo
 2. `npm install`
 3. `npm run start`

# Can I (re)use it?
You shouldn't, but I cannot stop you. I just require a credit note that would be visible.

# How to test?
Do you really want to test a portfolio page?

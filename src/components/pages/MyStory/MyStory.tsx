                Ever since I was young, I have had a deep affinity for the world of IT. Over nine years ago, I began my career as a programmer with an insatiable curiosity to explore all the different
                avenues of this vast field. In fact, I have explored various aspects of backend development, including working with technologies such as SpringBoot (<b className="highlight">Kotlin</b>
                ), PostgreSQL, and Docker. Through these experiences, I have gained a more comprehensive understanding of the IT field as a whole, and I remain eager to continue exploring new
                opportunities and challenges in this dynamic and exciting industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                As time passed, my focus shifted to <b className="highlight">Frontend Development</b>, despite my initial reservations about working with HTML and Native App platforms, which seemed
                incomplete or disorganized. All changed when I discovered <b className="highlight">React Native</b>. This powerful tool provided a streamlined solution for deploying applications on
                both OS platforms with ease and significantly reducing the cumbersome Angular boilerplate (that I had always found challenging). Through hard work and dedication, I'm becoming an
                expert in React Native, reaching my goal(s).
                <br />
                Now, I am eager to continue exploring and discovering new opportunities in this exciting and dynamic field.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have a <b className="highlight">Master Degree</b> in Computer Science & Engineering, acquired with sweat and hard work at University of Bologna. I'm a very transparent person and I'm
                not afraid to tell that my grade was <code>105/110</code>.

                In addition to my passion for programming and IT, I also have a keen interest in creating 3D objects using my 3D printer. I have honed my skills in programs like Blender and Fusion
                360, experimenting with different designs and materials to create unique and functional objects. While this is not my primary focus, it has been a fulfilling hobby that allows me to
                explore my creative side and learn new skills. Beyond 3D printing, I have also dabbled in other creative pursuits like using Photoshop and Video-Making. While I am by no means an
                expert in these areas, I enjoy learning new techniques and exploring the possibilities they offer. As with my programming work, my approach to these creative endeavors is largely DIY -
                I prefer to figure things out on my own and learn through trial and error. This DIY approach extends beyond my hobbies and into my daily life as well. I enjoy taking on new challenges
                and solving problems, whether that means fixing something around the house or finding a creative solution to a programming challenge. This mindset has served me well throughout my
                career and has allowed me to continually expand my knowledge and skills in the ever-changing field of IT.

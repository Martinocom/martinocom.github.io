      <h1>My story</h1>
      <p>
        Ever since I was young, I have had a deep affinity for the world of IT. 
        Over nine years ago, I began my career as a programmer with an insatiable 
        curiosity to explore all the different avenues of this vast field. 
        As time passed, my focus shifted to Frontend development, despite my 
        initial reservations about working with HTML and Native App platforms, 
        which seemed incomplete or disorganized. However, my world changed when 
        I discovered <b>React Native</b>. This powerful tool provided a streamlined 
        solution for deploying applications on both OS platforms with ease and 
        significantly reducing the cumbersome Angular boilerplate that I had always 
        found challenging. Through hard work and dedication, I'm becoming an expert 
        in React Native, reaching my goal(s).<br/>
        Now, I am eager to continue exploring 
        and discovering new opportunities in this exciting and dynamic field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a <b>Master Degree</b> in Computer Science & Engineering,
        acquired with sweat and hard work at University of Bologna. I'm also
        transparent with my grade, that was <code>105/110</code>.

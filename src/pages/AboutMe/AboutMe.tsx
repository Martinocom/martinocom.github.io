                In addition to my passion for programming and IT, I also have a keen interest in creating 3D objects using my 3D printer. I have honed my skills in programs like Blender and Fusion
                360, experimenting with different designs and materials to create unique and functional objects. While this is not my primary focus, it has been a fulfilling hobby that allows me to
                explore my creative side and learn new skills. Beyond 3D printing, I have also dabbled in other creative pursuits like using Photoshop and Video-Making. While I am by no means an
                expert in these areas, I enjoy learning new techniques and exploring the possibilities they offer. As with my programming work, my approach to these creative endeavors is largely DIY -

                Probably the best thing to do is to visit the <b className="highlight clickable">Project</b> page. But if you're too lazy, I'm the creator of{" "}
                <span className="moneyger">Moneyger </span> app. By my own I created (and/or released afterwards) some Open Source projects: small and big ones. Developing my app I contributed in some
                libraries that I'm using, helping solving problems or marking them. Also, this site is 100% made by myself not following any of the templates.
              </p>
              <p>
                As my personal project <span className="moneyger">Moneyger</span> can show, my main focus is on <b className="highlight">Frontend</b>, developing apps with <SiReact color="#20A4F3" />
                <span> React Native</span> and <SiTypescript color="#3F88C5" /> TypeScript{" "}
                <i>
                  (please don't use <SiJavascript color="#EAC435" />
                </i>
                ). As Frontend Dev I know how to test APIs with <SiPostman color="#f97d42" /> Postman and use <SiReactquery color="#ca1551" /> ReactQuery. I'm not scared about Backend things written
                in <SiKotlin color="#f97d42" /> Kotlin <i>(please stop using Java)</i>, as I explored environments of <SiSpring color="#23CE6B" /> SpringBoot,
                <SiPostgresql color="#6E7DAB" /> PostgreSQL and <SiDocker color="#3F88C5" /> Docker. Still, this is not my main focus, although I think that every good programmer should know at least
                what's going on <i>behind the scenes</i>. I also explored other platforms such as <SiRealm color="#B3001B" /> RealmDB and <SiFirebase color="#EAC435" /> Firebase. Important mentions
                goes to <SiWindows color="#167ee0" /> C# and WPF/UWP that I saw many years ago, but I liked them: XAML was way more standardized than HTML!
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm not scared about learning new thigs and I'm very flexible on doing that. They needs to be related on something I like, and when they're, I always achieve my goals quicker than any
                others.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have experience with some 3D modeling software, like <SiBlender color="#f97d42" /> Blender or <SiAutodesk /> Fusion 360.
                <br />I have a <SiRoundcube color="#6E7DAB" /> 3D printer and I like the DIY aspect of the life where you're the
                <i> architect of your own destiny</i>. <SiAdobephotoshop color="#3F88C5" /> Photoshop does not scare me; neither some Video Making software and <SiAudacity color="#0e41cd" /> Audacity
                does.
              </p>
              <p>
                All my previous phones (LG Nexus 5 and Xiaomi Mi A2) survived my SO and Kernel modding. My current Pixel 7 deserve a better threatment (for now). I'm always trying to find the best
                solution for all problems (software or hardware related), but since I can define myself as a "lazy" person, I'll find it way faster in order to achieve my objectives quicker.
              </p>
              <p>
                And finally, I like going to trips by foot or bike, and I really dislike the <i>rush to visit f***ing everything</i> in any place. I like to enjoy the moment, not to take pictures of
                it. I can play guitar and I always wanted to learn play piano, bass and drums <i>(programming wins for now)</i>.
